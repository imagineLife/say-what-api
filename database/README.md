# A Database Setup
Here, a layout for a mongodb config & setup.

## Config
The database will have several "configuration" options, with the default to a "localhost" db setup, where the db & the api are expected to both be accessible through "localhost".  

- **DEFAULT**: local development setup, looking for a db served from `localhost` off port 27017)
